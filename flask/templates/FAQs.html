            Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated levels of
            blood sugar (glucose) due to the body's inability to produce enough
            insulin or effectively use the insulin it produces.

      <!-- Example Context -->
      <div id="context" style="display: none">
        Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated levels of
        blood sugar (glucose) due to the body's inability to produce enough
        insulin or effectively use the insulin it produces. The main types of
        diabetes include type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational
        diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body
        doesn't produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes
        resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin. Gestational
        diabetes develops during pregnancy. Common symptoms of diabetes include
        increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight
        loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores or frequent
        infections. Diabetes is diagnosed through blood tests that measure blood
        sugar levels. These tests include fasting blood sugar test, oral glucose
        tolerance test, and A1C test. Risk factors for diabetes include obesity,
        physical inactivity, family history of diabetes, age, race, gestational
        diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and high blood pressure.
        Treatment for diabetes typically involves lifestyle changes such as
        maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, monitoring blood sugar
        levels, and taking medications as prescribed. For type 1 diabetes,
        insulin therapy is essential. Type 2 diabetes may also require oral
        medications or insulin injections. Diabetes can lead to various
        complications if left untreated or poorly managed. These complications
        include heart disease, stroke, neuropathy (nerve damage), kidney
        disease, eye damage (retinopathy), foot problems, skin conditions, and
        dental problems. Diabetes prevention involves adopting a healthy
        lifestyle, including eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy
        weight, staying physically active, and avoiding tobacco use. Regular
        screening for diabetes and prediabetes is also important for early
        detection and intervention. While there is no cure for diabetes, it can
        be managed effectively through proper treatment and lifestyle
        modifications. With appropriate management, many people with diabetes
        can live healthy and fulfilling lives. Various support resources are
        available for people with diabetes, including diabetes education
        programs, support groups, online communities, and healthcare
        professionals specializing in diabetes care. These resources can provide
        valuable information, support, and guidance for managing diabetes
        effectively.
